# mypervisor

Win 10 x64 kernel driver that installs a hypervisor in between windows 10 and bare metal hardware!

lotsa code in here for facilitating random kernel rootkit-like stuff. 

I wrote this as an experiment when i was playing around in the windows kernel

I also used this code to write Trumpervisor for the Hack The Vote 2016 CTF!
